SMS Linguistics (Android app)

Setup
-make sure you have Android 2.1 SDK (API7)
-make sure you import existing project into eclipse (under the general section, not android section)
-you might need to select to run as Android application on first run

The only dependency is AChartEngine, which is included.

Note: setup for development might be a little outdated; I recently added ActionBarSherlock in and upped the target API level.  When I setup a new computer next I'll update this.
