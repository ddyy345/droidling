SMS Linguistics (Android app)

I'm new to Git and Eclipse so I'm not sure if I added at the right level or not.  To get this working, you'll need to add AChartEngine to your workspace and set it up to be included.  The AChartEngine webpage has some instructions that'll help with that.

Setup
-make sure you have Android 2.1 SDK (API7)
-make sure you import existing project into eclipse (under the general section, not android section)
-you might need to select to run as Android application on first run
