Text message analytics for data junkies.  (Only compatible with standard SMS, not Google Voice, WhatsApp, or other alternative texting apps)

IN DEVELOPMENT
This is my first app and I'm still learning, so this is a work in progress.  Please post or email any feedback!  If you find any bugs, please describe your hardware and short steps to reproduce the bug.

Source code is available at https://github.com/ktrnka/droidling

PRIVACY
The app doesn't send your info to anyone unless you choose to do so by sharing.

The "write to external storage" permission is only used to draw the graphs to a temporary file for sharing.  The "read call log" permission was added automatically by Play Store.  The app doesn't use your call log.

COMPATIBILITY
This will only work if you have sent and received text messages and they're stored on your device in the typical place.  (Won't work with Google Voice SMS)

Key phrases may be poor in languages other than English, Spanish, French, Italian, German, Dutch, Russian, Norwegian, Portuguese, or Korean.  I've only done automated testing for non-English languages so let me know if it's good/bad.

Key phrases will be poor quality if you don't text much.  I'll be working to improve this in upcoming releases.

Interpersonal Stats' shared phrases may be poor if you text in different languages with different people.
