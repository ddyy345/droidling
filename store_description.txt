PRIVACY
The app doesn't send your info to anyone unless you choose to do so by sharing.

Permission details
(NEW in 1.2) READ_PROFILE: Get your profile picture for the main screen.
READ_SMS: Reads the messages to analyze.
READ_CONTACTS: Get the contact names for each phone number (the raw messages don't have this info). Also get the images for your contacts.
WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE: When sharing graphs, they must be written temporarily to storage before being shared.

COMPATIBILITY
This will only work if you have sent and received text messages and they're stored on your device in the typical place.  (Won't work with Google Voice SMS)

Key phrases may be poor in languages other than English, Spanish, French, Italian, German, Dutch, Russian, Norwegian, Portuguese, or Korean.  I've only done automated testing for non-English languages so let me know if it's good/bad.

Key phrases will be poor quality if you don't text much.  I'll be working to improve this in upcoming releases.

Interpersonal Stats' shared phrases may be poor if you text in different languages with different people.

IN DEVELOPMENT
This is my first app and I'm still learning, so this is a work in progress.  Please post or email any feedback!  If you find any bugs, please describe your hardware and short steps to reproduce the bug.
