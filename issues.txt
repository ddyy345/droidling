Known issues

Testing
-Personal Stats works for Igashu, contact-based stuff doesn't
-System gracefully fails on ICS (Tab), ICS (emulator), and 2.3.3 (HTC EVO 4g) with no messages
-System works properly on 2.2.1 (my phone) and ICS (emulator) when messages present
-When you don't have many texts, the extracted phrases are heavily skewed to trigrams

In Personal Stats:
-The share icon is smaller on the graph displays
-When you share a graph, it shares as jpeg T_T
-The share icon overlaps with the runtime stats
-The runtime stats aren't in any particular order

Interpersonal Stats:
-Nested phrases aren't handled well when there isn't much text to analyse, such as "merry christmas" "merry" and "christmas" all being in the list

GENUINE BUGS
-When someone has multiple cell numbers, only one of them is actually used
